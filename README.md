# Game Name: Weaponize

## Description
Duel Arena is an exciting 2D platform game that pits two players against each other in a thrilling battle. The goal of the game is simple: hit your opponent with your weapon before they hit you. The game is currently under development and will feature additional mechanics, levels, and a random case opening system to obtain various weapons.

## Gameplay
1. Spawning: The game begins by spawning the two players on opposite sides of the map.
2. Controls: Each player has control over their character, equipped with a weapon and a dash ability. The controls will be customizable and detailed in the game's options menu.
3. Movement: Players can move left and right on the platforms and jump between platforms, using strategy to gain an advantage.
4. Weapons: Each player starts with a default weapon. More weapons will be obtained through the random case opening system. Different weapons will have unique characteristics, such as range, damage, and attack speed, etc.
5. Combat: Players can attack by swinging their weapon at their opponent. The objective is to hit the other player before they hit you.
6. Lives and Damaged State: Each player has one life per round. When a player is hit, they become damaged for a set time. While in this state, the player can be eliminated by their opponent if they land a successful hit.
7. Dash Ability: Players have a dash ability that allows them to quickly evade attacks or close the distance between them and their opponent. 
8. Game End: As of now, the game ends when a player is hit by their opponent while in the damaged state. The players are then prompted with the option to play again or return to the menu.
